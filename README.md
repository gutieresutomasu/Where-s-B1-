## Where's B1? Biweekly Challenge

The purpose of this project is to create a collaborative learning space for [System Dynamics](https://www.systemdynamics.org) enthusiasts. 
Everyone, regardless of expertise, is welcome to participate!

Every 2 weeks we will post an article, your task is to model the system. 
You may choose to focus on the article's main question or bring a particular perspective you are interested in. 

We are excited to see what you'll come up with!

Follow these instructions to participate:
1. Check out the latest article. We will be posting in the [@wheres_b1](https://twitter.com/wheres_b1) account. 
2. Use the hashtag #WheresB1 on Twitter if you create your own model and would like to share it.
3. Include a picture of your model when you post on Twitter. 
4. Give others feedback or simply meet other modellers. :)
